# axisdefi.contracts

## Version : beta

The design of the axisdefi blockchain calls for a number of smart contracts that are run at a privileged permission level in order to support functions such as block producer registration and voting, token staking for CPU and network bandwidth, RAM purchasing, multi-sig, etc.  These smart contracts are referred to as the bios, system, msig, wrap (formerly known as sudo) and token contracts.
